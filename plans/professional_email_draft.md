We in IT have a large toolbox --- We can find solutions to any issue.

On a side note, we have an IT contractor starting next month 0 She has worked for MINCRON, goodman and just finished a full year at Baker.
We are not without the ability to support the organization.

If this is something that can be sone in pricefx lets do, if not let's talk about us developing some more tools for your team to use, 

Thank you

## Revised Version - Option 1 (Direct & Collaborative)

Hi Phil,

I'd like to schedule time to discuss your requirements in detail.

The IT team has extensive capabilities and experience solving complex business challenges. We're confident we can develop an effective solution for your needs.

Additionally, I wanted to mention that we have a seasoned IT contractor joining us next month. She brings valuable experience from MINCRON, Goodman, and most recently completed a full year at Baker. The IT team has strong capacity to support organizational initiatives.

Regarding your request: if this functionality can be implemented in PriceFX, we'll pursue that route. If not, we're ready to develop custom tools specifically designed for your team's workflow.

Let me know your availability for a discussion.

Thank you,

## Revised Version - Option 2 (Solution-Focused)

Phil,

I'd like to meet to discuss the best path forward for your requirements.

Our IT team has a comprehensive toolkit and proven track record of delivering solutions across the organization. We're well-positioned to support this initiative.

On the capacity front, we have a contractor starting next month with relevant industry experience (MINCRON, Goodman, and Baker), which further strengthens our ability to deliver.

Here's what I propose:
1. If PriceFX can accommodate this functionality, we'll implement it there
2. If not, we'll develop custom tools tailored to your team's specific needs

Both paths are viable. Let's connect to determine which approach best serves your objectives.

Thanks,

## Revised Version - Option 3 (Executive/Concise)

Phil,

Let's meet to align on the approach.

IT has the capabilities and capacity to solve this. We have a contractor with relevant industry experience joining next month, and we're ready to support.

Two options:
- Implement in PriceFX if feasible
- Develop custom tools if needed

What's your availability?

Thanks,
