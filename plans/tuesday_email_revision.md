## Revised Version - Option 1 (Casual & Upbeat)

Tuesday's are the best!

We're currently testing in production with Knoxville. Once they give us the green light, we'll roll out training to the other branches. After that, we'll be fully live with the create pending order functionality.

On the return shipment piece, just let us know when we're good to go from your end and we'll wrap up the back end work.

Thanks for everything you and Neil have been doing to help us get this across the finish line.

## Revised Version - Option 2 (Professional but Friendly)

Tuesdays keep getting better!

Quick update on where we are:
- Testing in production with Knoxville right now
- Once they approve, we'll train the rest of the branches
- Then we go live with the create pending order feature

For the return shipment piece, we're waiting on your confirmation that everything looks good on the reference side. Once we hear from you, we'll finish up the back end.

Really appreciate all the work you and Neil have put into this with us.

## Revised Version - Option 3 (Brief & Conversational)

Love Tuesdays!

Testing with Knoxville now. Once they're good, we'll train the other branches and go live with pending orders.

On the return shipment, just waiting for your OK on the reference piece before we finish the back end.

Thanks to you and Neil for all your help on this.
